This folder contains the filelists for the new evaluation framework proposed in the paper. 

## Test filelists for LRS2, LRS3, and LRW.

This folder contains three filelists, each containing a list of names of audio-video pairs from the test sets of LRS2, LRS3, and LRW. The LRS2 and LRW filelists are strictly "Copyright BBC" and can only be used for “non-commercial research by applicants who have an agreement with the BBC to access the Lip Reading in the Wild and/or Lip Reading Sentences in the Wild datasets”. Please follow this link for more details: [https://www.bbc.co.uk/rd/projects/lip-reading-datasets](https://www.bbc.co.uk/rd/projects/lip-reading-datasets). 


## ReSynCED benchmark

The sub-folder `ReSynCED` contains filelists for our own Real-world lip-Sync Evaluation Dataset (ReSyncED).


#### Instructions on how to use the above two filelists are available in the README of the parent folder.
